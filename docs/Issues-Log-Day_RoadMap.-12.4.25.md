# Working Flow Concerns for Skittly Repository

This document outlines key concerns and recommendations to improve the working flow of the [Skittly repository](https://github.com/timedilationv2/skittly). Addressing these concerns will streamline development, enhance code quality, and facilitate better collaboration.

---

## Concern 1: Project Structure & Organization

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Split the frontend (React) and backend (or shared scripts) into dedicated directories (e.g., `/frontend`, `/backend`).
  
- **Modularization:**  
  - Organize code into logical modules by separating reusable components, helper functions, and API integrations into distinct folders.
  
- **Consistent Naming & Conventions:**  
  - Establish and maintain consistent naming conventions for files, folders, and components to ensure scalability.

---

## Concern 2: Code Quality & Consistency

- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  - Integrate tools like ESLint and Prettier to enforce code standards.  
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    ```
  - Create configuration files (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`) and add lint/format scripts in `package.json`.

- **Type Checking:**  
  - Consider adopting TypeScript or using PropTypes (for React) to catch potential errors early.

- **Code Reviews & Commit Standards:**  
  - Use consistent commit message guidelines such as Conventional Commits or Commitizen to streamline changelogs and collaboration.

---

## Concern 3: Automated Testing & Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Unit & Integration Testing:**  
  - Implement testing using frameworks like Jest for both frontend and backend code.
  - Maintain a dedicated tests folder (e.g., `/__tests__` or `/tests`).

- **CI Workflow with GitHub Actions:**  
  - Create a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs linting, tests, and builds on every commit or pull request.  
  - Example Workflow:
    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '16'
          - run: npm install
          - run: npm run lint
          - run: npm test
    ```

- **Automated Package Publishing:**  
  - Consider adding a CI pipeline that automatically bumps versions and publishes your package when merging a release branch.

---

## Concern 4: Dependency & Security Management

- **Automated Dependency Updates:**  
  - Use tools like Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates.

- **Security Scanning:**  
  - Integrate security tools (such as Snyk or GitHubâ€™s built-in security alerts) to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.

---

## Concern 5: Documentation & Communication

- **Enhanced README & Wiki:**  
  - Update your main README with a clear project overview, structure explanation, and contribution guidelines.
  - Maintain a GitHub Wiki for deeper documentation, including guides, FAQs, and a roadmap.

- **Issue & PR Templates:**  
  - Create standardized templates for issues and pull requests to ensure all necessary details are provided.

- **Automated Changelogs:**  
  - Use tools like [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to generate changelogs based on commit messages.

---

## Concern 6: Developer Workflow & Environment

- **Local Development Environment:**  
  - Use Docker or setup scripts to create reproducible development environments for all contributors.

- **Task Automation:**  
  - Automate repetitive tasks (like cleaning build directories, running tests, or formatting code) with npm scripts or task runners like Gulp.

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Regularly review development practices with your team and adjust workflows based on collective feedback.

---

## Concern 7: Future Enhancements & Roadmap

- **Feature Toggles & Modular Releases:**  
  - Consider implementing feature toggles to manage experimental features without disrupting the main code base.

- **Scalability:**  
  - As the project grows, evaluate splitting into microservices or separate npm packages to keep components lightweight and maintainable.

- **Onboarding for New Contributors:**  
  - Develop clear onboarding documentation and guides to help new contributors set up their environments quickly and understand project conventions.

By addressing these concerns, your repository will become more streamlined, secure, and maintainable, paving the way for smoother development and better collaboration.
