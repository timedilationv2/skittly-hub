# Working Flow Concerns – Skittly Repository

This article outlines the key issues and challenges currently observed in the Skittly repository’s workflow. Addressing these concerns is the first step toward streamlining development, enhancing code quality, and facilitating better collaboration.

---

## Concern 1: Project Structure & Organization

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Split frontend (React) and backend (or shared scripts) into dedicated directories (e.g., `/frontend` and `/backend`).
  - Update documentation to reflect the new structure.

- **Modularization:**  
  - Organize reusable components, helper functions, and API integrations into distinct modules (e.g., `/frontend/components`, `/frontend/utils`).

- **Consistent Naming & Conventions:**  
  - Adopt standardized naming for files, folders, and components to ensure clarity and scalability.

---

## Concern 2: Code Quality & Consistency

- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  - Integrate ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent formatting and catch errors early.
  - Example installation:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    ```
  
- **Type Checking:**  
  - Adopt TypeScript or use PropTypes for React to prevent type-related issues.
  
- **Commit Standards:**  
  - Use a commit message convention (e.g., Conventional Commits) and tools like Commitizen to keep changelogs clear.

---

## Concern 3: Automated Testing & Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Testing Frameworks:**  
  - Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks such as Jest.
  - Organize tests in a dedicated directory (e.g., `/tests` or `/__tests__`).

- **CI Pipeline:**  
  - Create GitHub Actions workflows to run tests, linting, and builds on every commit/PR.
  - Example YAML snippet:
    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '16'
          - run: npm install
          - run: npm run lint
          - run: npm test
    ```

## Concern 4: Dependency & Security Management

- **Automated Dependency Updates:**  
  - Use tools like Dependabot to automate dependency update PRs.
  
- **Security Scanning:**  
  - Integrate security scanners (e.g., Snyk or GitHub Security Alerts) to catch vulnerabilities early.

---

## Concern 5: Documentation & Communication

- **Enhanced Documentation:**  
  - Update the README with a project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
  - Maintain a detailed wiki covering guides, FAQs, and a roadmap.
  
- **Issue & PR Templates:**  
  - Create standardized templates to streamline issue reporting and pull requests.

- **Automated Changelogs:**  
  - Use tools like [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to generate changelogs automatically.

---

## Concern 6: Developer Workflow & Environment

- **Local Development Environment:**  
  - Provide Docker configurations or scripts to ensure a consistent setup.
  
- **Task Automation:**  
  - Automate common tasks (such as cleaning build directories, running tests, and formatting code) using npm scripts or task runners.

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Regularly review development practices and update workflows based on team feedback.

---

## Concern 7: Future Enhancements & Scaling

- **Feature Toggles:**  
  - Consider implementing feature toggles to manage experimental features safely.
  
- **Modular Releases:**  
  - Plan for breaking the project into microservices or separate npm packages as it grows.
  
- **Onboarding:**  
  - Enhance onboarding documentation to help new contributors quickly understand and set up the project.
