# Solutions and Proposed Implementations

This document provides actionable solutions designed to address the working flow concerns identified in the Skittly repository. These solutions are intended to improve project structure, code quality, testing, and overall developer workflow.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

**Solution:**
- **Separate Directories:**  
  - Create dedicated folders such as `/frontend` for your React code and `/backend` for API/server code.
  - Update documentation (e.g., the README and this Wiki) with the new structure.
  
- **Modularization:**  
  - Organize reusable components and utilities into subdirectories (e.g., `/frontend/components`, `/frontend/utils`).
  - Follow consistent naming and coding conventions.

---

## 2. Code Quality & Consistency

**Solution:**
- **Linting and Formatting:**  
  - Integrate ESLint and Prettier.
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    ```
  - Create and maintain `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` configuration files.
  - Add relevant npm scripts for linting and formatting in `package.json`.

- **Type Checking:**  
  - Introduce TypeScript or PropTypes for improved robustness.
  
- **Commit Message Standardization:**  
  - Enforce clear commit message guidelines (e.g., Conventional Commits) and use tools like Commitizen.

---

## 3. Automated Testing & Continuous Integration

**Solution:**
- **Implement Testing:**  
  - Use Jest (or another testing framework) for unit and integration tests.
  - Store tests in dedicated directories (`/tests` or `/__tests__`).

- **Set Up CI/CD:**  
  - Create a GitHub Actions workflow (see example in the Working Flow Concerns article) to run tests and linting automatically.
  
- **Automated Publishing:**  
  - Configure a separate workflow to bump versions and publish packages automatically when merging to the release branch.

---

## 4. Dependency & Security Management

**Solution:**
- **Automated Updates:**  
  - Configure Dependabot or similar tools to automate dependency updates.
  
- **Security Scanning:**  
  - Enable security scanning using Snyk or GitHubâ€™s built-in security tools.

---

## 5. Improved Documentation & Communication

**Solution:**
- **Enhanced Documentation:**  
  - Regularly update the README and Wiki with detailed guides, a project overview, and onboarding instructions.
  
- **Templates:**  
  - Create Issue and PR templates to ensure all necessary details are provided.
  
- **Changelog Automation:**  
  - Use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to automatically generate changelogs based on commit messages.

---

## 6. Developer Workflow Optimization

**Solution:**
- **Local Development Setup:**  
  - Provide Docker configurations or setup scripts to ensure a reproducible environment.
  
- **Task Automation:**  
  - Use npm scripts or task runners to automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort.
  
- **Feedback Mechanism:**  
  - Schedule regular reviews of the development process and incorporate team feedback.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements & Scalability

**Solution:**
- **Feature Toggles:**  
  - Implement feature toggles to safely test and deploy experimental features.
  
- **Modular Releases:**  
  - Plan to split the codebase into microservices or separate npm packages as the project scales.
  
- **Contributor Onboarding:**  
  - Develop thorough onboarding documentation to help new contributors quickly get up to speed.
